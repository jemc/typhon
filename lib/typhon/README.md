Typhon implementation
=====================

This directory contains all ruby source files implementing the Typhon
compiler and runtime environment.

How Typhon works
================

Everything starts with a very basic `bin/typhon` ruby script. It loads
the typhon `compiler.rb`, runtime `environment` and executes the command line
interface `main.rb`
