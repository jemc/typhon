Runtime Environment
===================

A Python to Rubinius-bytecode compiler would be pretty much useless without
a way of running that as a valid Python program. To this end, Typhon
provides a full Python runtime environment; that is, core modules,
builtin function - everything you need to run your Python program on
Rubinius.

# TODO: document how python object model is implemented in Typhon.
# Add links to design/algorithm docs if needed.
